title: Procedural sound engine in Max/MSP
description: In order to better understand how procedurally generated sound can augment game engines such as Unity or Unreal, I built a prototype, object based, sound engine with Max/MSP. During the process I realised that scaling such system will be a major task therefore I shifted my focus onto Web Audio API scripting via Javascript.
