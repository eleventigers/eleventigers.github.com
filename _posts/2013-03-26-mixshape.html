title: Playlist generator and visualiser 'Mixshape'
description: What began as a freelance HTML5 canvas visualisation job, Microsoft backed Mixshape project quickly grew and I had to dive into all aspects of building this awesome online app which rearranges, generates and visualises Spotify playlists. During the course of development, I learned tons of new stuff whilst building my own canvas rendering engine driven by Backbone's model-view-* structures. Even though the design of Mixshape greatly challenged me a as developer, I enjoyed working within constraints which led me to find some amazing creative solutions.
